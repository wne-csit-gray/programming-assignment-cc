.SYNOPSIS
    Automates the setup and connection to a DevContainer environment using either Docker or Podman on Windows.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script automates the process of initializing, starting, and connecting to a DevContainer
    using either Docker or Podman as the container backend. It must be executed from the root
    directory of your project and assumes the script is located in a 'Script' subdirectory.

.PARAMETER Backend
    Specifies the container backend to use. Valid values are 'docker' or 'podman'.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Script\run_devcontainer_claude_code.ps1 -Backend docker
    Uses Docker as the container backend.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Script\run_devcontainer_claude_code.ps1 -Backend podman
    Uses Podman as the container backend.
